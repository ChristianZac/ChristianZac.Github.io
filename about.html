        <h3>From Christian</h3>
        <p>
            I still renember when i first layed eyes on her she was wearing a school uniform and I did not pay much attention the her, but
            I renembers I accidentally coverd her sweater in plastic glue from a glue gun and she was not even mad. Years later our paths cross and
            at first she was just one of the sweet girls ones I did not hang out with, but as we saw more of eachother i fell hard and
            from then it has just been magic and I cant belive in a few days I am offically making her my wife.
